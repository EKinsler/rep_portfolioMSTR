    <li style="text-align: left; font-family: dtm_mono; font-size: 25px;">Video Game Developer</li>
    <p class="desc"> All of my inspiration for developing and/or designing video games came from my childhood and general backstory. I have played video games ever since I was 4 years old. Playing practically every genre of games and mostly coming back to the OG, old-fashion video games, the biggest example being the PAC-MAN / Galaga arcade cabinet. All knowledge was gathered independently; I was entirely self-taught. </p>

    <li style="text-align: left; font-family: dtm_mono; font-size: 25px;">Web Designer</li>
    <p class="desc">Yep. I am also a web designer...with this webpage being part of what I know about web design. I gained the knowledge to design web pages from a college prepatory school in Phoenix, AZ called West-MEC. Humungous Kudos to Mr. Khadeem Bernard for teaching me everything he could about web-design. This website specifically puts the most easiest web design languages HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</p>

    <li style="text-align: left; font-family: dtm_mono; font-size: 25px;">Music Producer</li>
    <p class="desc"> I may not be good in Music Production as I am in video game development or web design but it is still fun to do as a hobby. The best I currently am at music production is recreating scores from either movies or video games. That's all, really.</p>
