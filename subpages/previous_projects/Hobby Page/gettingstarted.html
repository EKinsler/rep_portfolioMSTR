                        <p>My main hobbies dated all the way back to when I was introduced to Undertale in my Freshman year of High School.</p>                        
                        <p>Seeing how Undertale was made inspired me to create my own games. The game itself was programmed on an engine without writing one line of code, along with how generally simple it seemed to make, as well as what had to be used to make the choices and outcomes in the game become what they are now. The music, as admirable as it always has been, was made using mostly free instrument collections called “Soundfonts,” in a well-known and commonly used music production software that I have even learned to use a little bit myself. After seeing all of the comic dubs, animations and fan-game gameplay videos on YouTube, it sparked my idea to create my first game.</p>
