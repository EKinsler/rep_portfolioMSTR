        <p>I have one main goal for my hobbies and I surely hope people would join me throughout this journey. Some people may think it is weird, some people may think it is cancerous, some people may think it is interesting.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently in the last stages of designing a game I am planning on developing in GameMaker Studio. It is an Undertale Fangame called “The Multiverse”</p>
        
        <img src="the_multiverse.png">
        
        <p>This game will be a mere culmination of dozens and dozens of people’s different but creative adaptations to the Undertale universe. Featuring 10 AU’s created by the community Toby Fox and his game created over the past 4-5 years. The only thing I have to learn is GameMaker Language so I can create this game and make this highschool dream come true. I currently have pages upon pages upon pages of notes and writing brainstorming what would actually happen if 10 of these different AU’s would be in one huge game that I hopefully would be successful throughout the community.  </p>
