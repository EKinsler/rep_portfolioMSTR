                <p>My hobbies are fairly casual hobbies many other people would have.</p>
                
                <p>Usually hobbies that do not really benefit me in ways that a majority of my friend, family and sometimes even I understand...are video gaming, binging youtube, scrolling Youtube and Hulu and napping. My healtiest hobbies are trying to learn new things. Currently, I am learning a whole bunch of things. While I am learning web development languages such as HTML and CSS in West-MEC along with learning how to develop a stable job as a web developer, I am also learning a completely different programming language for a famous engine called GameMaker, specifically named GameMaler Language (GML). I am also learning how to make my own songs in a well-known music production engine named FL Studio.</p>

                <p>At the moment, my hobbies do not seem to be going away. I have been entertained by YouTube and video games my whole life and the other side of the entertainment I enjoy was changed around 2016 and 2017 when my family brought Netflix and Hulu into our lives. As of GameMaker and FL Studio, I have been really happy with my persuation to more in these fields. With GameMaker, I have now learned the basis on making multiple rooms and move around in those rooms. It is a small step but I is personally a step in the right direction.
