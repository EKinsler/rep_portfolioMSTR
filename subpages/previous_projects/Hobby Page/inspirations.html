                <p>I have DOZENS maybe even HUNDREDS of inspirations for what I want to do in my future.</p>

                <p>Some of my inspirations to persuade video game development are SEGA, Minecraft company, Mojang, Nintendo obviously and Toby Fox, creator of currently my favorite Indie RPG, Undertale. Undertale as a whole is a major inspiration for my future by itself. My inspiration to code basically comes from the very environment I grew up in and I feel like it is a good career choice because any industry that deals with coding is gradually growing in demand nowadays. My other inspiration that basically taught me to simply be myself would be a YouTuber named Carson King or "CallMeCarson" by his username on YouTube.</p></div>
